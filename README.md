# KUE RobOlympics 2025 Games

This is a collection of mini-games that were created by kids at the KUE RobOlympics 2025 event at the Google stand.
Each of the games was "vibe-coded" using Gemini in under 10 minutes. The following [system prompt](system_instructions.txt) was prepended to
speed-up the process.

The games are programmed in [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/) for [WioTerminal](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-p-4509.html).

## Installation

* Flash CircuitPython firmware to WioTerminal:
  * Attach the device to a computer via USB.
  * Download the .UF2 file for CircuitPython 9.x.x [here](https://circuitpython.org/board/seeeduino_wio_terminal/)
  * Drag the side-button down twice. The device will show up as a flash drive named 'Arduino'. Copy the .uf2 file to that drive.
  * The device will restart and appear as a flash drive named 'CIRCUITPY'
* Copy the contents of this directory over to the 'CIRCUITPY' drive (the code.py file must be at the root).

## Usage

Use the d-pad to navigate the menu and choose a game, click the d-pad to start the game. Drag the reset button to go back to menu.
